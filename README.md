✨ **CANABIS DECENTRALIZED MANAGER** ✨

## ADMINISTRATION ON CANNABIS PROGRAM IN SOLANA

The objective of this project is to develop a
DECENTRALIZED CANNABIS MANAGER
based on the Solana blockchain. This
administrator will allow users to create
events, participate as collaborators, sell
tickets and distribute the profits obtained to the
end the event.
These events will depend on the collaboration of
users to be carried out, since the
funds necessary for your organization,
will be obtained from the sale of Event Tokens that
users acquire as
collaborators. Those collaborating users
of the event will receive part of the profits
is generated from ticket sales.
These tokens will be worth 1:1 of a coin
specific assigned at the time of creating the
event, which will act as Accepted Currency in
All Transactions. The earnings
obtained from the Event Tokens are
will be deposited in a Treasury Vault. He
organizer may withdraw funds from the Vault
Treasury to cover related expenses
to the event.

Each event will put on sale a quantity of
inputs with a value defined at the time of
create the event. The profits obtained from the
Ticket sales will be deposited in a
Profit Vault.
At the end of the event, each collaborator will be able
withdraw the amount that corresponds to you from the
Profit Vault, value that is calculated from
proportional to the number of Tokens in the
Event acquired by each collaborator.
